When a full Pong Game is finished ("state the first to score?"), how will the game restart
- Paddle Configuration required for starting Pong
- When a goal is socred want to pause play ... controlled by a keyPress or mousePressed Button
- Able to celebrate and write instructions to the screen (images, movement of composite shapes, and text)
- When you are ready, start playing again

NOTE and CAUTION: a bug exists with the score board, be careful with what you copy

Final Versions of Procedural Pong in GitHub
- Exporting Processing (note: will not work in an EPSchools Network)
