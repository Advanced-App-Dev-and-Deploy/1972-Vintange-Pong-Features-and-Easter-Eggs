Computational Thinking: comparing two numbers for ... (displayWidth and displayHeight)
- Test for Preferred Orientation: Landscape, portrait, Square
  If the orientation is not Landscape, return how to make it a preferred orientation
  Note: Pong was meant to play on a 5:4 Screen (width: height)
- Advanced: forcing a window if the display geometry is outside the smallest allowable  largest ratio range or landscape depending on Display Geometry input
  - Solved by using a Resizable Window
